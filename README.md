# Calendar-Tool

I designed this project the summer before my first semester at Northeastern so I could easily and repeatedly import the events from my schedule into my Outlook calendar and remain organized during the semester.

A live version of this site is currently hosted at the following [link](https://my-schedule-plus-le4fl.ondigitalocean.app/) through DigitalOcean.
